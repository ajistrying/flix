1. Make a CRUD Interface for Genres
As our app stands, the list of genres can only be changed in the console. Although the set of familiar genres is fairly static and unlikely to change frequently, you still might consider standing up a web interface for managing genres. Bear in mind, only admin users should be able to create, update, and destroy genres.

You might also want a UI for listing out all the "comedy" movies or "action" movies. For example, on the genre show page, you could list the movies that are in that particular genre. And then on the movie show page, you could link each genre name so a user can see other movies in the same genre.

There's nothing new here to learn, but it's great practice if you want to layer in this functionality.

2. Friendly URLs for users and genres
